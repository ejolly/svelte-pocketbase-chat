# Svelte + Pocketbase

Quick demo app to show how to connect svelte with pocketbase for a realtime-chat app.

You'll need to follow the [pocketbase hosting directions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/#deployment-strategies) to setup up the database.

Then you can use the Javascript client SDK to connect to the database and listen for changes.
